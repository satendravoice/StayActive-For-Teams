# StayActive-For-Teams

**StayActive-For-Teams** is a Python-based application designed to keep Microsoft Teams active and prevent it from marking you as idle. It simulates user activity (by moving the mouse), ensuring that your Teams status stays as **"Available"** even when you’re away from your computer.

This tool features an intuitive **GUI**, a **progress bar**, and a **timer** to track how long the app has been running. You can also minimize it to the system tray and let it work silently in the background.
