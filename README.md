# StayActive-For-Teams
Teams-Active-Tool is a Python app that prevents Microsoft Teams from going idle by simulating user activity. With a simple GUI, it keeps your Teams status as "Available" even when you're away. It includes a progress bar, elapsed time tracker, and system tray integration for background operation.
