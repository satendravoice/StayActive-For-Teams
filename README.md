# StayActive-For-Teams

**StayActive-For-Teams** is a Python-based application designed to keep Microsoft Teams active and prevent it from marking you as idle. It simulates user activity (by moving the mouse), ensuring that your Teams status stays as **"Available"** even when you’re away from your computer.
